# Food Bridge – Hunger Reduction & Food Waste Management Platform

## Overview
**Food Bridge** is a UI/UX design project aimed at creating a digital platform (mobile/web) to connect food donors (restaurants, households, events) with receivers (NGOs, shelters, individuals in need) to reduce food waste and fight hunger. The project addresses the lack of organized, real-time systems for food donation by providing an intuitive and empathetic interface designed in Figma.

**Role**: UI/UX Designer  
**Duration**: February 2025 – March 2025

## Objective
To design a scalable platform that:
- Facilitates seamless food donation and distribution.
- Reduces food wastage by connecting surplus food with those in need.
- Enhances trust and coordination through real-time notifications and user verification.

## Problem Statement
Millions of people go hungry daily while edible food is wasted due to:
- Lack of real-time visibility of food availability or needs.
- Inconsistent and informal donation processes.
- Challenges in coordinating time-sensitive food pickups.

## Features
- **Donor Dashboard**: Add food listings, set pickup times, view donation history, and track requests.
- **Receiver Dashboard**: Browse available food, request pickups, and view verified donors.
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Alerts for donation matches and pickup status updates.
- **Map Integration**: Displays food locations and estimated pickup times.
- **Rating System**: Builds trust through user feedback and verification.
- **Food Freshness Status**: Visual cues to indicate food condition and expiry.

## Design Process
1. **User Research & Problem Validation**:
   - Conducted surveys via Google Forms and audio interviews with donors (restaurants, households) and receivers (NGOs, shelters).
   - Identified pain points: lack of visibility, trust issues, and time sensitivity.

2. **User Personas & Empathy Maps**:
   - Created personas for donors (e.g., restaurant owners) and receivers (e.g., orphanage managers).
   - Mapped goals, frustrations, and expectations to guide user-focused design.

3. **Information Architecture & User Flow**:
   - Structured navigation for donors (add food, track donations) and receivers (browse, request).
   - Designed intuitive user flows for seamless interactions.

4. **Wireframing**:
   - Sketched low-fidelity wireframes (hand-drawn and digital).
   - Developed high-fidelity wireframes in Figma for mobile and desktop.

5. **UI Design & Prototyping**:
   - Designed a clean, empathetic interface with the Poppins font and a consistent color palette (as per the style guide).
   - Incorporated visual cues (e.g., freshness status, map integration).
   - Built an interactive Figma prototype simulating the end-to-end user journey.

## Style Guide
- **Typography** (Poppins font):
  - App Title: 24-32px, Bold
  - Section Headers: 20-24px, Semi-Bold
  - Body Text: 14-16px, Regular
  - Labels: 12-14px, Medium
  - Buttons/Links: 24-32px, Semi-Bold
- **Iconography**:
  - Active (Filled): 32x32px
  - Passive (Outlined): 32x32px
- **Buttons**: Primary, Destructive, Disabled states for clear CTAs.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Figma**: Wireframing, UI design, and interactive prototypes.
- **Miro**: User flows and information architecture.
- **Google Forms**: Survey data collection.
- **Canva**: Icons and illustrations.
- **Pen & Paper / Notability**: Low-fidelity sketches.

## Project Outcome
- Delivered a fully interactive Figma prototype showcasing the complete user experience.
- Addressed a real-world problem using human-centered design principles.
- Created a scalable design model ready for MVP development.

## Why This Project Matters
Food Bridge demonstrates the application of UI/UX design to solve a societal issue, showcasing skills in:
- Empathizing with diverse user groups.
- Structuring intuitive and accessible interfaces.
- Translating research into actionable design solutions.
- Delivering end-to-end user journeys in Figma.
